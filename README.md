# Overview

In this assignment, we are implementing a randomized binary search tree.

The components of this program include:
* A `TreeSet<T>` class that can store arbitrary elements of type `T` in a binary search tree.
* A program `myspell` that uses the BST to implement a spell-checker.

# Footnote

Professor Kuenning's `ispell` implementation is based on the first `ispell` implementation, written by Pace Willisson, and is more properly referred to as *International Ispell*.
